## _CHESS GAME_
NOTE: This project was one of the earliest and was made before I became comfortable with object oriented programming in python consequentially the code is ugly and not well organised or optimised
-I plan on recreating the game using objects and better documentation of my code. This will also be available in this repository

## 2 PLAYER CHESS GAME 
INSTRUCTIONS:
White goes first

_To Move_:
to move click on a piece and the legal moves will be highlighted

_Taking a piece_:
to take an opponents piece you must click on the square behind it and not on the piece itself

_To win_:
to win you must take the opponent's king

There are no take backs and Checks are not shown on screen

Think hard before clicking on a piece because once clicked you must move it
