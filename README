## _CHESS GAME_
NOTE: This project was one of the earliest and was made before I became comfortable with object oriented programming in python consequentially the code is not well optimised
-I plan on recreating the game using objects and better documentation of my code. This will also be available in this repository

## 2 PLAYER CHESS GAME 
INSTRUCTIONS:
White goes first

_To Move_:
to move click on a piece and the legal moves will be highlighted

_Taking a piece_:
to take an opponents piece you must click on the square behind it and not on the piece itself

There are no take backs and Checks are not shown on screen

Think hard before clicking on a piece because once clicked you must move it
